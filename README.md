## Systems & Signals 1
# Welcome to the Systems & Signals 1 Repository!

The goal of this repository is to provide theory, formulas, methods, and examples based on the coursework of Systems & Signals 1 for second-year undergraduates studying Computer Science. 
Each cheat sheet serves as a summary for the different topics, as well as a guide for application and studying. 

Notice there is also a folder containing the .tex source code files, which you can upload and edit on TeX software systems such as LaTeX or OverLeaf, so as to make any additions or edits of the wanted content.

This repository is specifically intended to help understand, memorise methodologies, and practice for the final exam of the course.

Good luck! 😊💛
